## The TAM Roof
Grok and I were messing with my Monte Carlo robotaxi model ([link](https://github.com/reengineerit/robotaxi-model)), sizing up Austin, TX’s ride-hailing market. My model figures about 60k miles/year per robotaxi, argue that number if you want, but hey its my sandbox. After some math and Grok’s slick moves, we settled on 240M ride-hailing miles/year for Austin. Huge number, right? Divide by 60k, 4,000 robotaxis. That’s Austin’s roof.

Everyone’s hyped to get a Tesla into service or play robofleet boss, me too. But if 4,000’s even remotely close to right, saturation comes quick. Too many miners, not enough gold.

## Gold Rush Redux: Picks & Shovels
Think 49ers: miners starved, shovel sellers ate. Robotaxi fleet? Same vibe, 4,000 slots won’t feed all. The real cash might be in complementary gigs:  
- Car Washes/Detailing: 60k miles = grimy rides. Robo-bays or mobile crews bank it.  
- Tire Shops: High mileage eats tires. Bulk swaps = steady cash.  
- In-Vehicle Entertainment: No driver, just riders. Wi-Fi, screens, AR ads—content is king.

## Beyond the Obvious
Predictable routes get wild:  
- Pop-Up Shops: Coffee or tacos at robotaxi stops—no longer begging a grumpy Uber driver for detours.  
- Last-Mile Delivery: Package drops with bike-messenger flair—robotaxis haul, humans finish.  
- Customer-Aware Ads: Billboards and in-car screens swap ads based on who’s riding. Useful beats useless—I’m not here for random junk.  
- Curated Stops/Tours: Link with tourism crews—hit Austin’s must-sees, tickets pre-bought, destinations ready.

## Robovan: The Big Sister
Soon, robotaxis get a sibling: Robovan. Picture this:  
- Magicians or comedians gig for your crew en route to a hot spot.  
- Texas Hold ’em tourney rolling down I-35, deal me in!  
- Feeling stressed, how about a massage on the way to work.

The world as we know it is about to change.

## Takeaway
Robotaxi TAM is finite, 4,000 robotaxis in Austin. Fleet bosses will brawl for their share of the prize. Me? I’d sell shovels AND dig, after all if my car’s out hustling, that leaves me time to do the same. 

What’s your move going to be?
